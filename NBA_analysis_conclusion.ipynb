    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Each linked notebook contains multiple versions of that type of model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Linear Regression best model produced**:\n",
    "    - **RMSE**: 7,570,296\n",
    "    - **Accuracy Score**: 0.792\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Random Forest Regressor best model produced**:\n",
    "    - **RMSE**: 2,930,781.16\n",
    "    - **Accuracy Score**: 0.864\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The KNN Classifier's best model produced**:\n",
    "    - **Accuracy Score**: 0.54\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the results above, we can conclude that the best model for predicting an NBA player's salary based on the stats they produce is a **Random Forest Regressor Model**. Furthermore, the best version of this model was a version that removed the outliers from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Realization\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that I realized throughout this process is that players can have or add value without producing more stats. Traits such as leadership, character, work ethic, and basketball IQ are all traits that don't show up in the stat sheet but make a player more or less valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concluding Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while statistical models can provide significant insights into a player's value, they cannot capture the full spectrum of a player's contributions to their team. Inorder to improve the model factors that are not quantifiable need to be taken into account."
